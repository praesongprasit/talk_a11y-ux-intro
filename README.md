# Let's Play with a Screen Reader!

This 45mins talk was prepared for:
- [Investment Friday by UX Auckland](https://www.meetup.com/User-Experience-Auckland/events/285144292/) - 22nd April 2022

Accessibility is finally a hot thing in tech (Albeit, after years of neglect and many high profile lawsuits later... ðŸ¥‚ cheers Dominos)!

Majority of accessibility issues can be solved at the UX stage with some tools and thoughtful actions. The more UX practitioners understand different access needs, the better for products to be usable for all!

One of the tools that help users with different access needs use software, is called a screen reader. But how does one use this assistive technology? And how can designers create a good user experience for this audience? 

Let's run OSX VoiceOver over a site or an app to find out!
