						<p>Kia Ora, Sawasdee-ka, and hello.</p>
						<p>I'm so happy that you've joined us, to learn a little about screen readers with me today.</p>
						<p>I hope that by the end of this 40-45mins talk, you will have a better idea of how screen readers work.</p>
						<p>Hopefully, it'll also inspire you to start thinking about ways to ensure your designs cater for the <em>diverse</em> group of users who uses it.</p>

						<p>First, a little bit about me</p>

						<p>I'm a UX engineer, who loves helping people create accessible web products.</p>

						<p>And a host of Web Access Club, an accessibility podcast for web creators. Launching later this year.</p>

						<p>I've been in the NZ tech industry for about 8 years now, specialising in UI front-end work.</p>

						<p>I worked on large scale responsive sites like newzealand.com, and Xero Central - a customer help portal.</p>

						<p>These projects have given me a lot of experience working with UX practitioners. So I have a deep appreciation for this craft. I do owe a significant part of my career to designers I've worked with to solve all sorts of usabilty issues.</p>

						<p>In my free time, I practice Japanese archery, and eat around town. I am a little bit of a foodie.</p>

						<p>In the last couple of years, I've started to dive into wonderful world of web accessibility. Afterall, UI front-end's bread and butter, HTML, plays a crucial role.</p>

						<p><span aria-hidden="true">[Next]</span> That is why I'm here</p>

						<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">and add <bold>context</bold></span>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This year, I'm studying to become an internationally certified accessibility practitioner.</p>
						<p>What all that means, is that I'm no master at accessibility. Like all things UX, it's a continuous learning journey and craft.</p>

					<h2>When?</h2>
					
					<img class="stretch"
							src="img/ux-ui-flow.png"
							alt="UX-UI flow by Fen https://medium.com/nyc-design/ux-ui-design-process-for-beginner-753952bb2241">

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>How early should devs be involved? Depends</p>
						<p>What kind of project? Is it a technical solution? Or is it a brochureware site?</p>
						<p>Problem statements can be shared early</p>
						<p>User research sessions can have devs join in</p>
						<p>Data intensive projects can benefit from Dev wireframing. Yes UXers can do it with Axure, but devs don't have time to think about data models</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>How?</h2>

					<ul>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Ask</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Align test session with appropriate dev</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">Roster devs</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">Turn them into observers and/or note taker</li>
						<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">Share findings with the team</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>A lot of what I taked about means double budget (dev + design) early, which pays off</p>
						<p>Some devs, especially BEDs, see no point in this. FEDs are often on board</p>
						<p>When companies first try, they make devs sit in every testing session, both user and usability test. Pointless, deminishing return</p>
						<p>Data heavy prototype, get devs to sit in first session, fix, and followup</p>
						<p>Final synthesised findings give devs idea of how decisions are reached, important to them and not</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why not simply share finding?</h2>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">It's an investment in your developers, and the team</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Only sharing findings is like telling GoT beginning, and explain the ending</p>
						<p>A dev who see users right click, will remember to markup links correctly</p>
						<p>Small dev decisions are made without UX knowing. Database structure, allow scroll in iOS, how iframe gets put together and etc.</p>
						<p>A dev who have witness his/her take 10 seconds to load during a session, is more likely to be on board with performance projects</p>
						<p>Remind eachother of the experiences we've shared</p>

				<section>
					<h2>UX is a journey</h2>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						Best experience for developers <br>

					<h2>What next?</h2>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						UXer, go talk to your devs <br>
						Devs, ask to be involved
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Homework!</p>
						<p>UXer, find a dev. Dev, find UXer. Now talk about how you'd like to work with eachother</p>
						<p>We've turned UI into UX Designers through involvement in research. Lets Devs into UX Devs too</p>
